## PDSls

Navigate and manage [atproto](https://atproto.com/) repositories and the records they contain, as well as watching the relay in real time (firehose + jetstream support).

### Hacking

You will need `node` and `pnpm` to get started:

```
pnpm i      # install deps
pnpm dev    # or pnpm run start, runs vite
pnpm build  # runs vite build
pnpm serve  # runs vite preview
```
